## This directory contains terraform configuration for Smartling AWS/Terraform workshop #4 covered in blog post at [AWS/Terraform Workshop #4: S3, IAM, Terraform remote state, Jenkins](https://tech.smartling.com/aws-terraform-workshop-4-s3-iam-terraform-remote-state-jenkins-71c0d7512bf1)

---

### **Hands on:**

1. Go to w4 directory in cloned aws-terraform-workshops git repository.

2. **Create S3 bucket** for terraform remote state:
    
    2.1. cd remote_state, edit file `s3.tf`

    2.2. Define S3 bucket in terraform configuration (make sure versioning is enabled for it).
    
    2.3. Apply terraform configuration:
    ```
    $ terraform plan
    $ terraform apply
    ```
    > **Note:** keep track of s3_bucket_name output variable (to be used as remote state).

    2.4. `cd ../jenkins`

    2.5. Configure terraform to use newly created S3 bucket as a remote state, edit `backend.tf` with the s3 bucket information

3. **Deploy Jenkins** using terraform.

    3.1. Specify actual IDs of **AWS VPC**, **Subnet** and **Availability Zone** into `terraform.tfvars` file.

    > **Notes**: *Follow instructions in Hands On section of Workshop #2 or just copy values from it.*

    3.2. Change jenkins username and password in `terraform.tfvars` file.

    3.3. Define missing resources in terraform configuration according to comments ***.tf** files
  
    3.4. terraform plan and apply
    ```
    $ terraform plan
    $ terraform apply
    ```
  
    3.5. Get public IP address of EC2 instance that hosts Jenkins (output variable **jenkins_public**) and open *http://<jenkins_public>:8000* in the browser.

    > **Note:** *it takes about 4 minutes for Jenkins to bootstrap before it shows welcome/installation page.*

    3.6. Enter username and password configured in `terraform tfvars` and launch sample job **testjobs/demo**

4. **Destroy AWS resources** using `terraform destroy` command.

    4.1. Destroy EC2 jenkins:
    ```
    $ cd jenkins
    $ terraform destroy
    ```

    4.2. Destroy S3 bucket remote state:

    > **Note:** *terraform can't delete S3 bucket because itâ€™s not empty so you may need to go to S3 web console and delete all files and all their versions for remote tfstate file.*
    
    ```
    $ cd ../remote_state
    $ terraform destroy
    ```
